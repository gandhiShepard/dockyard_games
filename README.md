# Games
Dockyard Project: https://github.com/DockYard-Academy/curriculum/blob/main/exercises/games_guessing_game.livemd
Dockyard's Solution: https://github.com/DockYard-Academy/curriculum/tree/main/example_projects/games

I can see that this solution uses a GenServer, but this Games project hasn't reached OTP yet. So, I can see a need to refactor for using OTP later. 

## GuessingGame module
GuessingGame should prompt the user to guess a number between 1 and 10.

## Rock Paper Scissors
In your existing Games project, you're going to create a rock paper scissors game where players will play against an AI which randomly chooses rock, paper, or scissors.
